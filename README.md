# Networks_Analysis

*Part A-  investigate two different social networks*
1. build_graph - 
The function inputs a string â€“ the name of the data set, e.g., "PartB-C.csv" and returns a
networx.Graph object will represent the nodes, the edges, and weights (when they exist) as
they are at the data set.

2. plot_degree_histogram
The function inputs a dictionary representation of the degree histogram object and plots it.

3.  clustering_coefficient
The function inputs a graph and returns the clustering coefficient

*PART B - Diffusion models*

MODEL 1- Linear threshold model (deterministic, without using Lethality and R)

MODEL 2 - Independent cascade model (stochastic)

*PART C - choose_who_to_vaccinate*

we chose using top 50 patients with highest node rank
